# projectMain
The final amalgamation of the each induvidual part of the project

Currently(4/8/25 8:08 PM CST) there is an app.py that is a rough merge of Ethan's flask routes and the two audio separators in app.py, a copy of Jonny's datasetDownloader, all the uploads shared to the github, and a set of templates that are a nice starting place to begin finalizing the front end.
